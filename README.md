# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a frontend enthusiast based in Belgium. My passion lies in creating beautiful and functional user interfaces using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments and contributions to the web development community.

## About Me 🧑‍💻

- **Location:** Belgium 🇧🇪
- **Field:** Frontend Development
- **Skills:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Interests:** Responsive Design, Web Accessibility, UI/UX Design, Animation

## My Journey 🚀

For a long time, I was on and off the development path, stuck in a vicious circle of starting projects and never finishing them. Lately, working on challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and following a self-learning path has helped me break that habit. These small tasks keep me motivated and help me progress towards my goal of becoming a confident front-end developer.

A special shoutout to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell); thanks to his YouTube videos, I've regained my passion for web development! 🎉

## My Skill Set 💼

- **HTML5:** Crafting semantic and accessible web pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling with modern techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables.
- **JavaScript:** Building dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Learning Goals 📚

- **React:** Developing component-based user interfaces.
- **Next.js:** Building server-side rendered React applications.

## The End 😄

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, happy coding! 🚀
